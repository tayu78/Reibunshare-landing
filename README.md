## Why I'm going to create this app ?
I have studied English words for long time with vocabulary books but it is difficult to remember all of them since vocabulary is too many.

the example sentences vocabulary books have are sometimes useful , but many sentence is not useful in daily conversation. 

Sometimes I tried to create my own sentence for each words to memorize easily, but I thought I wish I could see the sentence the native speaker made.

this app help to solve this kind of problem.

## What users can do with this app

- register words or phrase
- post example sentence(vocabulary card) 
- add dialect tag (because expression is totally different with dialect)
- filter by tags
- save someone’s vocabulary card into your own vocabulary book
- save someone’s vocabulary book into your own shelf
- post with image  to visualize
- listen how to pronounce ( can check linking and accecnt)

 not limited with English (can add language tags and filter by them)
